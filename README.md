An illustrated banner shows a muscular person at a desk with a computer monitor and keyboard, eating chips from an orange bag. A green parrot sits on their shoulder. The monitor displays code, and the background text says “WELCOME, NEED SMT TAKE IT” in bold, light-colored letters. The color palette is muted, with earthy and dark teal tones.
